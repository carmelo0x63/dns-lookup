# a simple DNS lookup tool

Here's where to use these tools:

* Lookup tool (make queries to 8.8.8.8): https://dns-lookup.jvns.ca/
* Trace tool (see how DNS queries get resolved behind the scenes): https://dns-lookup.jvns.ca/trace.html

This is a website that makes DNS queries. It doesn't have an exciting name so
far. It's similar to [google's dns webmaster tool](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/),
but with simpler output and a button that lets you make all the DNS queries all at once.
